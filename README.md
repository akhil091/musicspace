![Screenshot 2024-08-27 212056](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37d6d5a1-e013-459c-b07b-0a4696be94ae)

This project is a Spotify-like music player built with React. The application allows users to play music, navigate between tracks, control volume, and view song details. It features a responsive design, fluid animations, and custom background color gradients based on the album cover. The app is built to match a provided Figma design and uses a REST API to load song data.

**API used:** https://cms.samespace.com/items/songs

## Features

- **Music Playback**: Play, pause, and skip tracks with custom controls.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Custom Hooks**: Utilizes React custom hooks for song navigation and state management.
- **Search Functionality**: Filters songs based on user input.
- **Dynamic Background**: Changes background color based on the album cover.
- **API Integration**: Fetches song data from a REST API.
- **Tab Navigation**: Navigate between different music categories.
- **Music Persistence**: Music playback persists across tab changes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **Anime.js**: For handling animations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **React H5 Audio Player**: For the audio player component.
- **react-icons** : For icons.
- **REST API**: For loading song data and album covers.


## Setup Instructions
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
